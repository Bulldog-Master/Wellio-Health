Complete outreach materials for clinician engagement.

## Email Sequence

### Email #1 — Introduction

**Subject:** Support patients without PHI exposure

**Body:**

Dear [Clinician Name],

Most telehealth platforms require clinicians to navigate complex PHI handling, consent management, and compliance overhead. Wellio takes a fundamentally different approach.

Wellio is a Wellness APP Platform that lets your patients track their wellbeing privately. If they choose to connect with you, you see only derived wellness signals — never raw logs, journals, or sensitive health notes.

**What you see:**
- Functional Wellness Index (FWI) scores
- 14-day and 30-day trends
- Adherence patterns (sleep, hydration, activity, mood)

**What you don't see:**
- Raw log entries
- Personal journals
- Medical vault documents
- Communication metadata

This model lets you support lifestyle behavior change without the compliance burden of handling PHI.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to explore how this could work for your practice?

Best regards,
[Your Name]

### Email #2 — Functional Patterns (Day 3)

**Subject:** How functional patterns improve patient outcomes

**Body:**

Hi [Clinician Name],

Following up on my previous note about Wellio.

One of the most powerful aspects of the platform is functional pattern recognition. Instead of reviewing raw data entries, you see computed signals that highlight:

- **Declining sleep quality** before patients report fatigue
- **Hydration inconsistency** correlated with reported symptoms
- **Activity patterns** that reveal recovery needs
- **Mood trends** that indicate intervention opportunities

These patterns are derived from patient-entered data, but you never see the raw entries — only the functional insights.

Patients feel safer sharing. You get better signal quality. Everyone wins.

[Your Name]

### Email #3 — Metadata Protection (Day 7)

**Subject:** Why metadata protection matters for patient trust

**Body:**

Hi [Clinician Name],

Here's something most platforms don't talk about: metadata.

Even when messages are encrypted, traditional platforms leak metadata — who communicated with whom, when, how often, and for how long. This creates a behavioral profile that can be exploited or subpoenaed.

Wellio uses cMixx technology from xx.network to eliminate metadata patterns entirely. When you message a patient through Wellio:

- No one can see that you communicated
- No one can see when the communication happened
- No one can correlate messaging frequency

This isn't just privacy theater — it's cryptographic metadata elimination.

Your patient relationships stay truly private.

### Email #4 — Pilot Program Invitation (Day 14)

**Subject:** Join the Wellio clinician pilot program

**Body:**

Hi [Clinician Name],

We're inviting a select group of clinicians to join our pilot program for Wellio's professional extension.

**Pilot benefits:**
- Free access to the clinician dashboard
- Direct support for integration
- Input into feature development
- Early access to new capabilities

**What we're looking for:**
- Clinicians interested in lifestyle medicine
- Practices supporting behavior change
- Providers seeking lower-compliance patient engagement tools

The pilot runs for 60 days with no commitment beyond.

Would you like to participate?

Best regards,
[Your Name]

## Objection Handling

### "I need raw data for clinical decisions."
"Wellio is designed for lifestyle support, not clinical diagnosis. The derived signals help you identify patterns that inform conversations with patients. For clinical data, patients use their existing health records systems."

### "How do I bill for this?"
"Wellio-informed consultations can be billed as wellness coaching or lifestyle counseling sessions, depending on your practice structure. The platform supports rather than replaces clinical workflows."

### "Is this HIPAA compliant?"
"Because Wellio specifically avoids transmitting PHI, the compliance burden is significantly reduced. Clinicians receive derived signals, not protected health information."
