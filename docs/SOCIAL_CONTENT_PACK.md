### Launch Announcement
```
Excited to announce Wellio — a privacy-first Wellness APP Platform.

We built Wellio because the health tech industry has a problem: users are forced to choose between useful insights and privacy.

Wellio solves this:
• Raw data stays on the user's device
• Derived signals (FWI) enable professional support
• Post-quantum encryption protects everything
• cMixx eliminates metadata exposure

For individuals: Track habits, get AI coaching, connect with professionals — all privately.

For trainers & clinicians: See functional trends without PHI exposure or compliance burden.

This is wellness without surveillance.

❌ Storing PHI
❌ HIPAA compliance burden
❌ Access to personal journals
❌ Metadata exposure

Wellio is a Wellness APP Platform that gives you what you need — functional trends and FWI scores — without the liability.

Professionals join by invitation. Clients control access. Everyone wins.
