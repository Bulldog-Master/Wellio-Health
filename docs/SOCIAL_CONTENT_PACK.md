### Thought Leadership

**Post 1: The Privacy Problem**
"Most wellness apps promise to help you get healthier. But they also collect every detail of your life — your sleep patterns, what you eat, who you talk to.

Wellio takes a different approach. We built a Wellness APP Platform where your data stays on your device. Professionals can help you — but only see derived insights, never your raw logs.

Privacy isn't a feature. It's the foundation."

**Post 2: For Professionals**
"If you're a trainer, coach, or clinician wondering how to support clients digitally without taking on compliance risk — Wellio is designed for you.

Our APP Platform lets individuals share high-level wellness signals with trusted professionals. No PHI. No raw logs. No liability exposure.

Privacy-first wellness support."
