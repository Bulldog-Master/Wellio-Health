## Part 1: Trainer/Coach Training

### Video Script: Welcome to Wellio (3 minutes)

**[Scene 1: Intro - 0:00-0:30]**

"Welcome to Wellio's Professional Extension for trainers and coaches.

I'm going to show you how Wellio helps you support your clients more effectively — while respecting their privacy."

**[Scene 2: The Problem - 0:30-1:00]**

"Traditional coaching apps give you full access to your clients' data. Sounds helpful, right?

But here's what happens: clients hold back. They filter what they log. They edit their notes. They don't share the full picture.

Why? Because they feel watched."

**[Scene 3: The Wellio Difference - 1:00-1:45]**

"Wellio flips this model.

Your clients log everything freely — because their raw data stays private. You see trends and patterns, not raw entries.

Here's what you CAN see:
- FWI scores — their daily wellness signal
- Trend patterns — 14 and 30-day views
- Adherence indicators — sleep, hydration, activity

Here's what you CAN'T see:
- Raw log entries
- Personal journal notes
- Meal descriptions
- Sleep diary details

The result? Clients share more. You get better signal. Everyone wins."

**[Scene 4: Dashboard Tour - 1:45-2:30]**

"Let me show you the coach dashboard.

[Screen recording]

This is your client list. Each card shows:
- Their FWI score
- A trend arrow
- Adherence flags

Click into a client and you see:
- Their FWI trend chart
- Breakdown by category
- Quick access to messaging

Notice what's NOT here: no raw logs, no personal notes, no private details."

**[Scene 5: Getting Started - 2:30-3:00]**

"Ready to get started?

1. Sign up as a professional at wellio.app
2. Wait for your clients to download Wellio
3. They'll send you an invite code
4. Enter the code to connect

That's it. You're now receiving their wellness insights — privately and securely.

Welcome to the future of coaching."

### Coach FAQ

**Q: Why can't I see my client's raw logs?**
A: Privacy builds trust. Clients log more honestly when they control what's shared. You get better signal quality through derived insights.

**Q: What if I need more detail?**
A: Ask your client directly. They can choose to share more verbally or in messages. The platform defaults to privacy; humans can expand sharing.

**Q: How do I know if a client is struggling?**
A: Watch for FWI drops, declining trends, and adherence flag changes. These signal when to check in.

**Q: Is messaging secure?**
A: Yes. All messages are post-quantum encrypted and routed through cMixx for metadata protection.

**Q: Can I see when clients are online?**
A: No. We don't expose online status, typing indicators, or communication metadata.

## Part 2: Clinician Training

### Video Script: Wellio for Clinicians (4 minutes)

**[Scene 1: Intro - 0:00-0:30]**

"Welcome to Wellio's Clinician Extension.

I'm going to show you how Wellio enables you to support patient lifestyle change — without PHI exposure or compliance burden."

**[Scene 2: The Challenge - 0:30-1:15]**

"Remote patient monitoring is valuable but risky.

Traditional platforms require you to handle PHI. That means:
- HIPAA compliance overhead
- Data storage liability
- Consent management complexity
- Breach notification obligations

For lifestyle support — not clinical care — this burden often exceeds the benefit.

Most clinicians avoid remote engagement entirely. Patients miss out on support."

**[Scene 3: The Wellio Approach - 1:15-2:00]**

"Wellio takes a fundamentally different approach.

Patients track their wellness privately. If they choose to connect with you, you see only derived signals — never raw data, never PHI.

What you see:
- Functional Wellness Index scores
- 14 and 30-day trend patterns
- Adherence indicators by category

What you don't see:
- Raw log entries
- Personal journals
- Medical vault documents
- Communication metadata

This isn't a limitation — it's a feature. You get clinically useful signals without regulatory exposure."

**[Scene 4: Clinical Value - 2:00-2:45]**

"Let me show you what this looks like in practice.

[Screen recording]

Here's a patient's FWI trend. Notice the decline starting two weeks ago.

Looking at the breakdown:
- Sleep adherence dropped
- Hydration inconsistent
- Activity stable
- Mood declining

This pattern suggests intervention opportunity — before the patient even reports symptoms.

You can message them, suggest a check-in, or note the pattern for their next visit.

All without accessing their private logs."

**[Scene 5: Compliance Clarity - 2:45-3:30]**

"Let's talk compliance.

Because Wellio specifically avoids transmitting PHI:
- You're not a covered entity for Wellio data
- No additional BAAs required
- No data storage on your systems
- Clear data boundaries by design

This is wellness support, not clinical monitoring. The platform architecture enforces this distinction."

**[Scene 6: Getting Started - 3:30-4:00]**

"Ready to try it?

1. Register at wellio.app/clinicians
2. Verify your credentials
3. Your patients download Wellio
4. They send you an invite code
5. You connect and begin receiving signals

Wellio: Clinically useful. Compliance-light. Privacy-first.

Welcome to the future of lifestyle support."

### Clinician FAQ

**Q: Is this HIPAA compliant?**
A: Wellio specifically avoids PHI transmission. You receive derived wellness signals, not protected health information. This significantly reduces compliance exposure.

**Q: Can I use this for clinical decisions?**
A: Wellio provides lifestyle insights for supportive guidance, not clinical diagnosis. Use FWI trends as conversation starters and behavior indicators.

**Q: What if a patient needs clinical intervention?**
A: Wellio may surface patterns warranting clinical attention. Follow your standard protocols for clinical care — Wellio supplements, doesn't replace.

**Q: How do I bill for this?**
A: Wellio-informed consultations can be billed as wellness coaching or lifestyle counseling, depending on your practice structure.

**Q: Can patients revoke access?**
A: Yes. Patients can disconnect you instantly. You'll immediately lose access to their signals.
