# WELLIO — Investor One-Pager

---

## Overview

Wellio is the first AI-powered **Wellness APP Platform** built with **post-quantum security** and **metadata elimination** at its core.

It is:
- Individual-centered wellness tracking
- Privacy-first by design
- Optional professional extensions (trainers, coaches, clinicians)
- Zero-knowledge privacy architecture

---

## Master Positioning Statement

**Wellio is a next-generation Wellness APP Platform that empowers individuals to track their wellbeing privately — while optionally connecting with trainers, coaches, or clinicians through secure, limited-visibility insights. It is privacy-first, post-quantum secure, and powered by cMixx metadata protection.**

---

## Problem

Health & wellness apps leak:
- Identity
- Patterns
- Behaviors
- Metadata

This destroys trust and restricts adoption by both privacy-conscious individuals and professionals.

---

## Solution

Wellio introduces the **Functional Wellness Index (FWI)** — a privacy-preserving signal derived from daily behaviors:

| Signal | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Sleep | Quality and duration tracking |
| Meals | Nutrition logging and adherence |
| Hydration | Daily water intake |
| Workouts | Activity completion and intensity |
| Mood | Emotional state tracking |
| Recovery | Rest and recuperation metrics |

**Raw data stays on device.**  
**FWI and trends are shared — nothing else.**

---

## Security Architecture

The APP Platform is built with a zero-trust architecture. Raw logs never leave the user's device. All communication is protected with post-quantum encryption (ML-KEM-768) and cMixx metadata-elimination technology.

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **ML-KEM-768** | Post-quantum key establishment (NIST FIPS 203) |
| **AES-256-GCM** | Encrypted storage |
| **cMixx (xx.network)** | Metadata elimination for messaging |
| **Zero-Trust Architecture** | Server cannot read user data |
| **Secure Enclaves** | Medical vault data protection |
