# WELLIO — Investor One-Pager

---

## Overview

Wellio is the first AI-powered wellness platform built with **post-quantum security** and **metadata elimination** at its core.

It combines:
- Consumer wellness tools
- Professional coaching platform
- Clinician insights layer
- Zero-knowledge privacy architecture

---

## Problem

Health & wellness apps leak:
- Identity
- Patterns
- Behaviors
- Metadata

This destroys trust and restricts adoption by professionals and clinicians.

---

## Solution

Wellio introduces the **Functional Wellness Index (FWI)** — a privacy-preserving signal derived from daily behaviors:

| Signal | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Sleep | Quality and duration tracking |
| Meals | Nutrition logging and adherence |
| Hydration | Daily water intake |
| Workouts | Activity completion and intensity |
| Mood | Emotional state tracking |
| Recovery | Rest and recuperation metrics |

**Raw data stays on device.**  
**FWI and trends are shared — nothing else.**

---

## Technology Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **ML-KEM-768** | Post-quantum key establishment (NIST FIPS 203) |
| **AES-256-GCM** | Encrypted storage |
| **cMixx (xx.network)** | Metadata elimination for messaging |
| **Zero-Trust Architecture** | Server cannot read user data |
| **Secure Enclaves** | Medical vault data protection |
