**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

### Wellio Launches First Privacy-First Wellness APP Platform with Post-Quantum Encryption

Wellio today announced the launch of the world's first Wellness APP Platform centered on individual privacy, with optional support from trainers, coaches, and clinicians.

Unlike coaching platforms or EMR systems, Wellio is built for individuals first. The APP Platform keeps all raw wellness data on the user's device and allows only high-level derived signals — such as the Functional Wellness Index (FWI) — to be shared with professionals, if the user chooses.

The APP Platform is secured with post-quantum encryption (ML-KEM-768) and cMixx metadata elimination, setting a new standard for privacy in digital wellness.

## C. Short Description (App Stores)

> "Wellio is a privacy-first Wellness APP Platform for individuals, with optional support from trainers, coaches, and clinicians. Raw data stays on your device — only derived wellness insights can be shared, if you choose."

---

## D. Long Description (Website / Press Kit)

> Wellio is a next-generation Wellness APP Platform that empowers individuals to track their wellbeing privately — while optionally connecting with trainers, coaches, or clinicians through secure, limited-visibility insights.
>
> Unlike traditional wellness apps, Wellio never stores raw journals, meal logs, or medical notes on its servers. Instead, Wellio derives a Functional Wellness Index (FWI) — a privacy-preserving signal that empowers professionals without exposing personal details.
>
> The APP Platform is built with a zero-trust architecture. Raw logs never leave the user's device. All communication is protected with post-quantum encryption (ML-KEM-768) and cMixx metadata-elimination technology.
>
> Professionals gain powerful insights. Users retain complete control.
