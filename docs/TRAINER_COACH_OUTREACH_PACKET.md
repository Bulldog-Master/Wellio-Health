## Email Sequence

### Email #1 — Introduction

**Subject:** A new way to support your clients privately

**Body:**

Hi [Coach Name],

What if your clients could share their wellness data with you — without feeling like they're being watched?

Wellio is a Wellness APP Platform that lets clients track their sleep, meals, hydration, activity, and mood privately. If they choose to connect with you, you see trends and insights — never their raw logs or personal notes.

**What you see:**
- Functional Wellness Index (FWI) scores
- Trend patterns over time
- Adherence indicators
- Video session integration

**What you don't see:**
- Raw journal entries
- Personal meal notes
- Sleep diary details
- Communication patterns

Clients actually share MORE when they feel safe. Better data. Better coaching. Better results.

Best,
[Your Name]

### Email #2 — FWI for Coaches (Day 3)

**Subject:** How the Functional Wellness Index transforms coaching

**Body:**

Hi [Coach Name],

Following up on my previous note about Wellio.

The Functional Wellness Index (FWI) is a game-changer for coaches. Instead of asking clients to manually report their week, you see a computed score that reflects:

- Sleep quality and consistency
- Nutrition adherence
- Hydration patterns
- Activity levels
- Mood trends

**One number. Instant context.**

When a client's FWI drops from 78 to 62, you know something changed. You can ask the right questions without making them feel interrogated.

Want to see a demo of the coach dashboard?

Best,
[Your Name]

### Email #3 — Trust-Based Coaching (Day 7)

**Subject:** Why privacy builds better coaching relationships

**Body:**

Hi [Coach Name],

Here's what we've learned: clients share more when they control what's shared.

Traditional coaching apps require full data access. Clients hold back. They filter what they log. They edit their notes before syncing.

Wellio flips this model. Clients log freely because their raw data stays private. You see trends and patterns — the signal without the noise.

**The result:**
- More honest tracking
- Better pattern recognition
- Stronger coaching relationships
- Higher client retention

Privacy isn't a barrier to coaching. It's the foundation of trust.

Want to try it with a few clients?

Best,
[Your Name]

### Email #4 — Pilot Program (Day 14)

**Subject:** Join the Wellio coach pilot program

**Body:**

Hi [Coach Name],

We're inviting trainers and coaches to join our pilot program.

**Pilot benefits:**
- Free access to the coach dashboard
- Priority support
- Input on feature development
- Early access to new tools

**What we're looking for:**
- Coaches who value client privacy
- Trainers interested in data-informed coaching
- Professionals seeking better engagement tools

No commitment. 60-day pilot. See if it works for your practice.

Interested?

Best regards,
[Your Name]

## Objection Handling

### "I need to see raw data to coach effectively."
"The FWI and trend patterns actually give you better coaching signal. You see what matters without the noise. Clients log more honestly when they have privacy, so the patterns are more accurate."

### "What if clients hide something important?"
"Clients can always share more if they choose. The default is privacy, but they control visibility. Most coaches find clients share MORE because they feel safe."

### "How is this different from other coaching apps?"
"Most apps require full data access. Wellio is built on privacy-first architecture. Clients see everything; you see derived insights. It's a fundamentally different model."
