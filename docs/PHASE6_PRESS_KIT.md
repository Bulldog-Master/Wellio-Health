## BRAND OVERVIEW

### Tagline
> **"AI-powered wellness. Quantum-private by design."**

### Positioning Statement
> Wellio is a next-generation Wellness APP Platform that empowers individuals to track their wellbeing privately — while optionally connecting with trainers, coaches, or clinicians through secure, limited-visibility insights. It is privacy-first, post-quantum secure, and powered by cMixx metadata protection.

### Key Differentiators
1. **On-Device Processing** — Raw logs never leave the device
2. **Post-Quantum Encryption** — ML-KEM-768 for future-proof security
3. **cMixx Metadata Protection** — Communication patterns are invisible
4. **Derived Signal Sharing** — Professionals see insights, not logs

## BOILERPLATE

### Short (50 words)
> Wellio is a privacy-first Wellness APP Platform that keeps your health data on your device. Track sleep, nutrition, movement, and mood privately. Invite trainers or clinicians who see only derived insights — never your raw logs. Protected by post-quantum encryption and cMixx metadata elimination.

### Long (150 words)
> Wellio is a next-generation Wellness APP Platform designed for individuals who value both their health and their privacy. Unlike traditional wellness apps that upload personal data to servers, Wellio keeps all raw logs on your device, computing your Functional Wellness Index (FWI) locally.

> For those who want professional support, Wellio offers optional extensions for trainers, coaches, and clinicians. These professionals see only derived wellness signals — trends, adherence patterns, and functional scores — never your meals, notes, or metadata.

> Security is built into every layer: ML-KEM-768 post-quantum encryption protects against future quantum computer attacks, AES-256-GCM secures the medical vault, and xx Network's cMixx technology eliminates metadata from all communications.

> Wellio represents a new paradigm: wellness improvement without surveillance. Your health belongs to you.
