Internal reference for consistent APP Platform terminology across all communications.

## ⭐ Core Identity

| Element | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **APP** | It is an application users interact with daily |
| **Platform** | It supports multiple user types & a broader architecture |
| **Wellness** | Functional, lifestyle, holistic — not medical |
| **Privacy-first** | Post-quantum encryption + cMixx metadata protection |
| **Optional professional extension** | Not required but available |

## 🎯 Master Positioning (Use Everywhere)

> **Wellio is a privacy-first Wellness APP Platform built for individuals — with optional support from trainers, coaches, and clinicians. Raw data stays on the user's device, and only derived wellness insights can be shared, if the user chooses.**

This sentence is the north star. Everything in the deck, website, docs, README, onboarding, etc. is built around this.
