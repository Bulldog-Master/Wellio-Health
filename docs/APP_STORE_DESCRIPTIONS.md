A privacy-first Wellness APP Platform for individuals, with optional support layers.

## Long Description

Wellio is a next-generation Wellness APP Platform designed for individuals who want to understand and improve their wellbeing — privately.

Track your sleep, meals, hydration, movement, mood, and recovery through the Functional Wellness Index (FWI). Everything stays on your device with post-quantum encryption and cMixx metadata protection.

If you choose, you can invite a trainer, coach, or clinician to view your high-level wellness signals. They cannot access raw logs, journals, or personal health notes.

Private. Secure. Individual-first.
