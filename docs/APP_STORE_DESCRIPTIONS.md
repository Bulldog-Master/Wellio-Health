**A Wellness APP Platform, Reimagined for Privacy.**

Wellio is a privacy-first Wellness APP Platform built for individuals — with optional support from trainers, coaches, and clinicians. Raw data stays on your device. Only derived wellness insights can be shared, if you choose.

**YOUR HEALTH, YOUR CONTROL**

Unlike other wellness apps that sell your data, Wellio keeps your raw logs on your device. Only you decide what to share, and you can revoke access anytime.
