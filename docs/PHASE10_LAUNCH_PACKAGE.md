### SECTION 1 – What is Wellio?

**Title:** Built for individuals. Designed for privacy.

**Body:**
Wellio is a Wellness APP Platform that helps individuals understand and improve their wellbeing without trading away their personal data. You get deep, AI-supported wellness insights—while your raw logs, journals, and vault stay on your device.

**Bullets:**
- Functional Wellness Index (FWI) – your private daily score
- "Today at a Glance" dashboard
- Sleep, meals, hydration, movement, and mood tracking
- Encrypted Medical Vault for sensitive documents
- AI wellness guidance without data selling
- Secure messaging and optional video sessions

---

### SECTION 2 – Functional Wellness Index (FWI)

**Title:** One private score. Many insights.

**Body:**
FWI combines signals from your sleep, food, hydration, movement, recovery, and mood into a single daily score. It lives on your device—and only moves if you decide to share derived insights with a professional.

**Sub-bullets:**
- Sleep quality & consistency
- Meal timing & balance
- Hydration habits
- Movement & activity patterns
- Mood & stress reflections

**Tagline:** FWI helps you see the big picture, without exposing the details.

---

### SECTION 3 – APP Platform Architecture

**Title:** A platform with you at the center.

**Body:**
Wellio isn't a coaching platform or a medical system. It's an APP Platform where:
- Individuals use the full wellness experience
- Trainers & coaches can be invited to see trends
- Clinicians can be invited to see functional patterns

All under strict, user-controlled data boundaries.

**Diagram text:**
- Individual → APP Platform (FWI + logs + vault)
- Optional derived signals → Trainer / Coach / Clinician
- Raw data stays on device

---

### SECTION 4 – Security & Privacy

**Title:** Privacy isn't a feature. It's the foundation.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Post-Quantum Encryption** | ML-KEM-768 keeps keys secure now and in the future, even against quantum attacks |
| **Metadata Protection (cMixx)** | cMixx hides who is talking to whom, and when—so your patterns stay private |
| **Zero-Trust Design** | Our servers never see raw logs, journals, or vault contents. We operate on the assumption that no server should be trusted with your data |

---

### SECTION 5 – For Trainers & Coaches

**Title:** Support your clients—without reading their logs.

**Body:**
Wellio gives trainers and coaches a clear view of client wellness trends, without exposing personal entries.

**Bullets:**
- See FWI and adherence trends
- Support behavior change with real context
- Never access raw logs, journals, or vault documents
- Communicate via secure, metadata-protected channels

**CTA:** Learn how the APP Platform supports training

---

### SECTION 6 – For Clinicians

**Title:** Functional patterns, not PHI.

**Body:**
Clinicians can optionally plug into the APP Platform to see non-PHI functional signals that support lifestyle and behavioral change—without inheriting the risk of storing or handling PHI.

**Bullets:**
- View functional wellness trends, not raw entries
- No PHI, no vault data, no journals
- Reduced compliance and storage risk
- Support patients' lifestyle programs with privacy-respecting data

**CTA:** Explore the clinician extension
