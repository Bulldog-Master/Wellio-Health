## PRIVACY MESSAGING (Marketing Safe)

### Headline Claims

**✅ Safe to Use:**
- "Your data stays on your device"
- "Privacy-first by design"
- "Post-quantum encryption"
- "Professionals see trends, not logs"
- "We can't access what we don't have"

**❌ Avoid:**
- "100% unhackable" (impossible claim)
- "We never collect any data" (we collect some metadata)
- "HIPAA compliant" (unless formally certified)
- "Medical grade" (without certification)

- Wellness logs (sleep, meals, hydration, movement, mood)
- Medical vault documents
- Personal notes and journals

**Transmitted (Derived Signals Only):**

## SECURITY CLAIMS

### Encryption
> "All sensitive data is encrypted using AES-256-GCM for storage and ML-KEM-768 for key exchange, providing protection against both current and future quantum computing threats."

### Metadata Protection
> "Communications through Wellio are routed via xx Network's cMixx technology, which eliminates metadata patterns that could reveal who you communicate with and when."

### Zero-Trust
> "Wellio operates on a zero-trust model. We cannot access your raw wellness logs because they are never transmitted to our servers."
