# Wellio + cMixx Integration

**Metadata-Private Communication Architecture**

## Overview

Wellio is a privacy-first Wellness APP Platform for individuals, with optional connections to friends, family, colleagues, trainers, coaches, and clinicians. Raw data remains strictly on-device, and only derived wellness insights may be shared.

To enable truly private communication between users and their chosen supporters, Wellio integrates **xx network's cMixx protocol**. Unlike traditional encrypted messaging, cMixx removes metadata entirely—preventing adversaries from learning who is communicating, how often, or when.

---

## Why cMixx Is Required

Most encrypted communication platforms still leak:

- Sender and receiver identity
- Communication frequency
- Timing and correlation patterns
- Relationship structures
- Behavioral inferences (e.g., therapy sessions, coaching engagement, relapse patterns)

In wellness and clinical contexts, metadata is itself highly sensitive. cMixx solves this through:

- Sender-receiver unlinkability
- Precomputation-based batching
- Timing obfuscation
- Strong anonymity sets
- Traffic analysis resistance
- Forward-secure PQ-safe design

This is essential for protecting users who engage with:

- Coaches
- Clinicians
- Mental-wellness supporters
- Friends or colleagues in sensitive circumstances

---

## Integration Points

### 1. Derived Insight Delivery

All outbound insight packets (FWI, adherence, trend summaries) are transported through cMixx.
No timestamps, raw logs, or behavioral patterns are leaked.

### 2. Messaging

Every message exchanged with supporters—personal or professional—is routed through the mixnet.
This prevents leakage of:

- Communication intensity
- Sleep/wake cycle inferences
- Program adherence patterns
- Therapeutic escalation windows

### 3. Session Scheduling

Session reminders and check-ins are especially sensitive.
These, too, are delivered exclusively through cMixx.

### 4. Future Real-Time Signaling

Video & voice session signaling will use cMixx for metadata elimination prior to encrypted media transport.

### On-Device Layer

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Raw logs | Personal activity, nutrition, mood data |
| Journals | Private notes and reflections |
| FWI computation | Functional Wellness Index calculated locally |
| Medical Vault | PQ-encrypted (ML-KEM-768) medical records |

### Derived Insight Layer

| Insight | Recipients |
|---------|------------|
| FWI score | All authorized supporters |
| Trend analysis | Coaches, clinicians |
| Adherence metrics | Coaches, clinicians |

### cMixx Transport Layer

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| Mixnet batching | Fixed batch sizes prevent traffic analysis |
| Timing obfuscation | Breaks temporal correlations |

|------|------------|
| **Friends/Family/Colleagues** | High-level summaries only |
| **Coaches/Trainers** | FWI + trends + adherence |
| **Clinicians** | Functional patterns (no PHI) |

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies

```json
{
  "xxdk-wasm": "^0.3.22",
  "@noble/post-quantum": "^0.5.2"
}
```

### Key Components

| Component | Location | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| `useCmixConnection` | `src/hooks/network/` | cMixx network connection |
| `useE2EEncryption` | `src/hooks/encryption/` | E2E encryption layer |
| `careTeamVisibility.ts` | `src/features/care-team/` | Visibility rules |

## Failure Modes

Wellio follows a **fail-closed** model:

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| cMixx network unreachable | Messages **not sent** — user notified |
| xxdk WASM fails to load | Messaging **disabled** |
| Key exchange failure | Conversation **not created** |

**Rationale**: Downgrading to plain WebSocket would expose metadata, defeating the privacy promise.

## Conclusion

cMixx is foundational to Wellio's mission. It enables a multi-role wellness support ecosystem—friends, family, colleagues, coaches, and clinicians—without exposing relationships, behavioral cycles, or identity metadata.

Wellio becomes a flagship real-world demonstration of **metadata-private, post-quantum wellness technology** built on xx network infrastructure.
