Your data stays on your device. We analyze behaviors — not identity.

## 🔗 xx Foundation / Investor Narrative

### Why Wellio Is a Fit for xx.network

Healthcare and fitness platforms today require users to surrender identity, metadata, and personal logs to participate. This creates compliance exposure for practitioners and destroys user trust.

Wellio is the first wellness system designed with **zero-knowledge participation**:

- Behavior stays local
- AI runs on the user's device
- Messaging is encrypted end-to-end
- Metadata disappears through cMix

Instead of storing PHI, Wellio computes **derived functional signals** — clinically useful without regulatory gravity.

This unlocks a new category:

**A decentralized, quantum-private performance network** connecting individuals, coaches, and clinicians without exposing identity or data trails.

xx.network provides the routing layer Wellio needs to prove:

**Health data can be useful without being dangerous.**
