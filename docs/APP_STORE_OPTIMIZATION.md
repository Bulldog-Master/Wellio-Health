**Wellio — Your Private Wellness Command Center**

Wellio is a next-generation Wellness APP Platform designed for individuals who want to understand and improve their wellbeing — privately.

**🔐 Privacy-First Architecture**
Unlike every other wellness app, Wellio keeps your raw data on YOUR device. We can't see it. We can't sell it. We can't lose it. Your logs, journals, and health notes stay private.

**📊 Functional Wellness Index (FWI)**
Track your sleep, meals, hydration, activity, and mood. Wellio combines them into one powerful score — your FWI. See trends. Spot patterns. Improve your day.

**🔒 Post-Quantum Encryption**
Your data is protected with ML-KEM-768 encryption — the same standard governments are adopting to protect against future quantum computer attacks. Privacy that lasts.

**🛡️ Metadata Protection (cMixx)**
Most apps leak metadata — who you communicate with, when, how often. Wellio eliminates this through cMixx technology. No patterns. No profiles. No surveillance.

**👥 Optional Professional Support**
If you choose, invite a trainer, coach, or clinician. They see your wellness trends — never your raw logs, journals, or personal notes. Support with boundaries.

**💊 Encrypted Medical Vault**
Store lab results, prescriptions, and health documents securely. Biometric-locked. AES-256 encrypted. Only you can access them.

**🤖 AI Wellness Companion**
Get personalized insights powered by AI — without sending your data to external servers. Private intelligence that improves your wellbeing.

**Features:**
• Private logging (sleep, meals, hydration, activity, mood)
• Functional Wellness Index scoring
• Trend analysis and pattern recognition
• Encrypted medical document vault
• Optional professional connections
• Post-quantum encryption (ML-KEM-768)
• Metadata protection (cMixx)
• AI-powered insights
• Video sessions with professionals
• Secure messaging

**Who is Wellio for?**
• Individuals who value privacy
• People tracking health habits
• Anyone managing wellness data
• Users seeking professional support without PHI exposure
• Privacy-conscious health enthusiasts

**Privacy Promise:**
Your raw logs never leave your device. Professionals only see derived insights. Wellio servers cannot access your data. Period.

Download Wellio today. Own your wellness.
