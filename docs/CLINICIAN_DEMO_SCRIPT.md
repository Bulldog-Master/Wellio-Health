---

### Highlight FWI Score

> "Wellio converts complex daily behavior into a single metric: the Functional Wellness Index, or FWI."

---

### Show 30-day Trend

> "Trends help clinicians spot patterns early — improvements, declines, or recovery moments — all without revealing sensitive details."

---

### Show Patient Flags

> "Flags summarize adherence signals: sleep, hydration, meals, activity, and mood."

---

### Cut to Video Sessions

> "When a deeper check-in is needed, live video sessions are just one click away — and your signaling traffic is protected by xx.network's cMixx metadata elimination."

---

### Cut to Messages

> "Messaging is end-to-end encrypted with post-quantum cryptography, ensuring that even future adversaries cannot decrypt past conversations."

---

### Final Screen with Wellio Logo

> "The APP Platform is built with a zero-trust architecture. Raw logs never leave the user's device. Wellio empowers clinicians to support patients safely, ethically, and effectively."
