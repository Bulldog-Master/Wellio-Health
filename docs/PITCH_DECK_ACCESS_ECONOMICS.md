## SLIDE 1 — THE APP PLATFORM ARCHITECTURE

### Zero-Knowledge Access Model
**Functional insights, not raw personal data.**

The Wellness APP Platform separates raw logs from derived functional signals, ensuring professionals only see what they need — and never what exposes the user.

**Visual:** 3-layer vertical stack:
1. **User Device (Private Data Layer)** — Icons: logbook, heart, meal, workout. Label: "Raw Data — Local Only"
2. **Wellio Derivation Layer (glowing outline)** — FWI Gauge icon. Label: "Derived Functional Signals (FWI, Trends, Adherence)"
3. **Professional View Layer** — Coach/Clinician icons. Label: "Limited, high-level visibility"

| Role | Access |
|------|--------|
| **Individuals (Primary)** | Full access to logs, notes, documents, trends, FWI score |
| **Trainers & Coaches** | ✔ Functional Wellness Index (FWI)<br>✔ Trend lines (14–30 days)<br>✔ Adherence categories<br>✘ No raw meal/workout logs<br>✘ No journals or personal notes<br>✘ No metadata |
| **Clinicians** | ✔ Functional signals & trends<br>✔ Adherence breakdown<br>✘ No PHI / medical vault data<br>✘ No metadata<br>✘ Not a diagnostic system |

### Security Infrastructure
- Post-quantum key exchange (ML-KEM-768)
- AES-256-GCM / ChaCha20-Poly1305
- xx.network cMixx routing for metadata protection
- E2EE for messaging & notes
- All professional access is explicit, revocable, and derived from the Care Team model

> **Tagline:** Wellness insights without exposing identities or private logs.

## SLIDE 2 — ACCESS MODEL (INVITE & RELATIONSHIP FLOW)

### User-Controlled Professional Access
**Professionals Don't See More Than They Should.**

**Visual:** Horizontal flow diagram with clean black → dark slate gradient (#000000 → #16161A)

**Flow:**
```
[Generate Invite Code] → [Client Enters Code] → [Pro Accepts] → [Derived Data Shared]
```

1. **Professional creates an invite code**
   - One active code per role (coach or clinician)
   - Revocable, auditable, usage-tracked

2. **Individual enters invite code from Care Team**
   - Creates a relationship request
   - No PHI exchanged during onboarding

3. **Professional accepts request**
   - Gains visibility only to derived functional signals
   - Messaging enabled, fully encrypted

4. **Individual may revoke access at any time**
   - Immediately removes professional visibility
   - No retroactive data exposure

**Callout:** Access is revocable at any moment and syncs across all devices.

> **Key Advantage:** Professionals can support outcomes without inheriting liability.

**Professionals get incentives to bring clients in:**
