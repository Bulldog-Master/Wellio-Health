## Script

**[Founder on screen, clean background]**

Hi, I'm Bulldog — and this is Wellio.

**[Cut to app interface]**

Most wellness apps collect your data, store your logs, and expose your patterns. Wellio does the opposite.

**[Back to founder]**

Wellio is a privacy-first Wellness APP Platform built for individuals. You can track your wellbeing, understand your habits, and improve your daily life — without ever giving up your personal data.

**[Show FWI score animation]**

Your raw logs stay on your device. Your messages and sessions are protected with post-quantum encryption and cMixx metadata elimination.

**[Show Care Team interface]**

If you want support, you can invite a trainer, coach, or clinician — but they only see derived wellness signals, never your private notes or medical information.

**[Back to founder, confident close]**

Wellio is wellness, reimagined for privacy.

Welcome to the future of personal health.
