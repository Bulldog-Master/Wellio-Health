## Script

### [0:00-0:15] — Hook

"Every wellness app wants your data.

They track what you eat. When you sleep. How you move.

Then they sell it.

We built something different."

---

### [0:15-0:30] — Introduction

"Wellio is a privacy-first Wellness APP Platform.

It's built for individuals — with optional support from trainers, coaches, and clinicians.

The key difference?

Your raw data never leaves your device."

---

### [0:30-0:50] — How It Works

"Here's how it works.

You track your daily habits — sleep, meals, workouts, hydration, mood.

Wellio calculates your Functional Wellness Index, a daily score from 0 to 100.

That score? That's what professionals can see.

Not your meal logs. Not your journals. Not your personal notes.

Just the derived signal — the FWI."

---

### [0:50-1:05] — Professional Layer

"Trainers and coaches see trends and adherence — enough to help you improve.

Clinicians see functional patterns — no PHI, no compliance burden.

They join only when YOU invite them.

And you can revoke access anytime."

---

### [1:05-1:20] — Security

"We didn't just add encryption.

Wellio uses post-quantum cryptography — ML-KEM-768 — protecting your data from future threats.

And cMixx metadata protection means nobody knows who you're talking to, when, or how often.

Not even us."

---

### [1:20-1:35] — Mission

"We believe health improvement shouldn't require surveillance.

That professionals can help you without seeing your private logs.

That privacy and progress can coexist."

---

### [1:35-1:45] — Call to Action

"Wellio is free to start.

Download today and take control of your wellness — without giving up your data.

This is wellness without surveillance.

This is Wellio."
