# Wellio — TikTok / Instagram Reels Scripts

20 high-performing growth hooks for social media.

---

## 🎥 1. "The Wellness App That Doesn't Track You"

**Hook:** "Your wellness app is tracking you right now. Here's the one that doesn't."

**Script:**
"Every wellness app uploads your sleep, your meals, your mood to their servers. Wellio keeps it all on your device. Private. Encrypted. Yours."

**CTA:** "Link in bio for private wellness."

---

## 🎥 2. FWI Explained

**Hook:** "One private score that changes how you understand your day."

**Script:**
"Sleep. Meals. Hydration. Activity. Mood. Wellio combines them into one score — your Functional Wellness Index. See your patterns. Improve your day. Without sharing your data."

**CTA:** "Get your FWI score."

---

## 🎥 3. Privacy Comparison

**Hook:** "What your wellness app sees vs. what Wellio sees."

**Visual:** Split screen
- Left: "Other apps" — full data stream
- Right: "Wellio servers" — just a lock icon

**Script:**
"Other apps see everything. Wellio servers see nothing. Your data. Your choice."

---

## 🎥 4. Professional Extension

**Hook:** "You can invite a trainer — and they STILL can't see your logs."

**Script:**
"Invite a coach. They see your trends. Your FWI score. Your progress. But your journals? Your raw logs? Your personal notes? Completely private."

**CTA:** "Wellness with boundaries."

---

## 🎥 5. Clinician Safety

**Hook:** "Clinicians: Want lifestyle insights without PHI? Here's how."

"Wellio gives clinicians derived wellness signals — not raw data, not PHI, not compliance risk. Support your patients. Reduce your liability."

**CTA:** "Learn more for clinicians."

---

## 🎥 6. Vault Security

**Hook:** "Your medical documents deserve AES-256 + PQ encryption."

**Script:**
"Lab results. Prescriptions. Medical records. Wellio encrypts them with military-grade security — plus post-quantum protection for the future."

**CTA:** "Secure your health records."

---

## 🎥 7. The cMixx Advantage

**Hook:** "This is how Wellio hides your messaging patterns."

**CTA:** "Message without metadata."

---

## 🎥 8. "Why I Switched"

**Hook:** "I deleted MyFitnessPal. Here's what I use now."

---

## 🎥 9. Post-Quantum Explained

## 🎥 11. "Trainers React"

**Hook:** "When trainers find out they can't see raw logs..."

**Script:**
"At first they're confused. Then they realize — clients actually share MORE when they feel safe. Better data. Better coaching. Better trust."

---

## 🎥 12. "What Clinicians Love"

**Hook:** "A clinician told me this changed how they support patients."

"They see functional patterns, not PHI. Lifestyle trends, not medical records. They can support behavior change without compliance risk."

## 🎥 13. "The Medical Vault"

**Hook:** "Where do you store your lab results? (Not in your camera roll.)"

**Script:**
"Wellio has a medical vault. Encrypted. Biometric-locked. Post-quantum secured. Your health records, actually protected."

---

## 🎥 14. "Wellness Apps Are Lying"

**Hook:** "They say your data is 'secure.' Here's what they don't tell you."

**Script:**
"Secure doesn't mean private. They can still read it. Still analyze it. Still share patterns. Wellio is different. Zero access. Zero trust. Zero compromise."

---

## 🎥 15. "The FWI Challenge"

**Hook:** "Track your FWI for 7 days. See what you learn."

**Script:**
"Sleep. Meals. Hydration. Movement. Mood. Watch your score change. Spot your patterns. Improve your habits. All private."

---

## 🎥 17. "Metadata Matters"

## 🎥 18. "The Privacy Test"
