## 30-Second Version (Social Ad)

Instead, it keeps everything on your device — protected with post-quantum encryption and metadata elimination.

Track your sleep, meals, hydration, movement, and mood privately.

Invite a trainer or clinician only if you choose — and they see insights, not your logs.

Wellio: A Wellness APP Platform built around your privacy."

## 60-Second Version (Founder Cut)

### Script
"Hi, I'm Bulldog — and this is Wellio.

Most wellness apps collect your data, store your logs, and expose your patterns to third parties. Wellio does the opposite.

Wellio is a privacy-first Wellness APP Platform built for individuals like you. You can track your wellbeing, understand your habits, and improve your daily life — without ever giving up your personal data.

Your raw logs stay on your device. Your messages and sessions are protected with post-quantum encryption and cMixx metadata elimination.

If you want support, you can invite a trainer, coach, or clinician — but they only see derived wellness signals, never your private notes, journals, or medical information.

We believe health improvement shouldn't require surveillance.

Wellio is wellness, reimagined for privacy.

Welcome to the future of personal health."

### Visual Beats
- 0-5s: Founder on screen, clean background
