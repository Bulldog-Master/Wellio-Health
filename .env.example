# ⚠️  SECURITY NOTE FOR CODE REVIEWERS:
# 
# This file (and .env) contains ONLY publishable/public keys that are:
# - Designed by Supabase to be exposed in client-side browser code
# - Protected by Row Level Security (RLS) policies, not key secrecy
# - Required for the Supabase client SDK to function
#
# This is NOT a security vulnerability. See docs/SECURITY_FAQ.md for details.
